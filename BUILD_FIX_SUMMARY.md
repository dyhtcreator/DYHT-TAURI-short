# Dwight Build Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

The build errors have been successfully fixed. The original issues were:

1. **Missing `identifier` field** - Added `"identifier": "com.dwight.desktop-agent"` in `tauri.bundle.identifier`
2. **Incomplete Tauri configuration** - Added missing fields: `allowlist`, `bundle`, `updater`
3. **Incorrect configuration structure** - Fixed to match Tauri v1.x format
4. **Missing system dependencies** - Installed required Linux packages
5. **Library version mismatches** - Created compatibility symlinks

## Build Results

âœ… **BUILD SUCCESSFUL!**

The Dwight executable has been successfully created:

- **Main executable**: `src-tauri/target/release/dwight` (Linux binary, equivalent to Dwight.exe on Windows)
- **Convenient symlink**: `./Dwight` (for easy access from root directory)
- **Distribution packages**:
  - `dwight_0.1.0_amd64.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu package)
  - `dwight-0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` (RedHat/Fedora package)  
  - `dwight_0.1.0_amd64.AppImage` (Portable Linux app)

## How to Build

Use the provided build script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run build
npx tauri build
```

## Running the Application

On Linux:
```bash
./Dwight
```

On Windows (after building on Windows):
```cmd
.\Dwight.exe
```

## Notes

- The executable will require a graphical environment to run properly
- On Linux, you may see libsoup warnings which are harmless
- The configuration is now compatible with Tauri v1.x
- All required dependencies have been properly configured
